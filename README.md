# WINDOWS-EVENT-LOGS-ANALYSIS-Report
This repo contains a Windows Event Logs analysis where I traced an attacker’s activity by filtering key Event IDs. I identified a malicious account, the user who created it, the date it was enabled, and confirmed a password reset attempt. Demonstrates log analysis and investigative skills.
